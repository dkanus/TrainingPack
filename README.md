# TrainingPack

This mutator was created as a collection of simple commands to help me and my friends with practicing solo games and grew rather large after awhile. I won't be updating or fixing this one and will (or already have by now) be replace by a different mutator I'm planning. This is just as-is release of something I've been using.

**NOTE:** This mutator was developed to be used on the servers with ScrN balance and NicePack present (even in vanilla mode, when they were inactive). For this release I've prepared a version that doesn't have NicePack dependency (and another without even ScrN one), but help entries for commands may still hint at it; just ignore these mentions if you aren't using NicePack.

**NOTE 2:** Since this mutator was developed mainly to aid with solo practice, - there's no limitation on who can use it's commands. So it's not meant to be used on public servers.
